# receipt-prototype-1
An app that tracks the name, amount and date of user expenses. Need to implement SQLite

I have no idea how to use GitHub so I'm just writing stuff at this point
The app uses three activities(Main, Second and Third) as the different screens, and receipts are managed by a Receipt Manager class.
I need to implement reading/writing to an SQLite Database in order to save user-created receipts.
Will I ever do that?
I don't know.
I'm not really interested in finishing this project up at the moment.
